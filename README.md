# Meals-and-Glucose

We deliberately get rid of participant number 3, because the headers are missing and the column names cannot be inferred due to the lack of values in each row. We also excluded particiants 7, 13, 15, and 16 because their date recorded for glucose level recording are not matched with the date in food_log database. 

Resulting categories: 
male-high: 9, 11
male-low: 2, 12, 14
femal-high: 4, 5, 6, 10
female-low: 1, 8
